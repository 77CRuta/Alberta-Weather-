# 🌤️ Edmonton Weather Analysis

## 📋 Summary of Findings

This analysis covers daily weather records from four long-running Edmonton-area stations — **Blatchford**, **International CS**, **Stony Plain**, and **Stony Plain CS** — spanning **2000 to February 17, 2026**. All comparisons are made against a 25-year baseline (2000–2024).

---

### 🏔️ Long-Term Climate Baseline

Edmonton's climate is strongly continental: cold, long winters and short, warm summers. Across the 25-year baseline, the annual mean temperature is **+3.85 °C**, with average monthly means ranging from **−9.5 °C in December** to **+17.7 °C in July** — a swing of roughly 27 °C. Temperatures remain below freezing on average from November through March. Snowfall is concentrated in October through April, with the snowpack typically peaking at around 16–18 cm in January and February.

---

### 📅 2025 vs Baseline

2025 was a **warmer-than-average year overall**, with an annual mean of **+4.61 °C** against the baseline of **+3.85 °C** (+0.76 °C). However, the year was far from uniformly warm — it was defined by sharp contrasts between mild and cold periods.

#### 🌡️ Temperature Highlights

| Month | 2025 (°C) | Baseline (°C) | Delta (°C) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| January | −6.10 | −9.38 | +3.28 | Well above average |

| November | −1.99 | −3.50 | +1.51 | Warmer than average |
| December | −13.85 | −9.54 | −4.31 | Very cold — Arctic outbreak |

- **September** was the warmest anomaly of the year at **+3.75 °C above baseline**, driven by an unusually persistent warm airmass extending well into fall.
- **February** and **December** were both roughly **4.5 °C below baseline**, representing two distinct Arctic outbreaks that bookended the year.
- Most of the middle of the year (March through November) ran above average, with only July coming in slightly below.

#### ❄️ Snowfall Highlights

| Month | 2025 (cm/day) | Baseline (cm/day) | Delta (cm/day) |
|---|---|---|---|
| January | 1.58 | 0.69 | +0.89 |
| February | 0.23 | 0.54 | −0.31 |
| **March** | **2.39** | **0.76** | **+1.63** |
| October | 0.04 | 0.31 | −0.27 |
| November | 0.41 | 0.62 | −0.21 |
| **December** | **2.26** | **0.52** | **+1.74** |

- Despite the warmer annual average, the snowpack ran **39% above baseline** (10.48 cm vs 7.54 cm average snow on ground).
- The heaviest snowfall anomalies were in **March** (+1.63 cm/day) and **December** (+1.74 cm/day).
- The cold February and December slowed melting and preserved accumulation, explaining the outsized snowpack relative to total snowfall.

### 🗓️ January & February 2026 vs Baseline

The first two months of 2026 continued the volatile pattern established in 2025, but with anomalies that exceeded anything seen in the prior year.

#### 🌨️ January 2026

| Metric | January 2026 | Baseline | Delta | Delta % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mean Temperature (°C) | −7.53 | −9.38 | +1.84 | +19.7% |
| Max Temperature (°C) | −2.64 | −4.58 | +1.94 | +42.3% |
| Min Temperature (°C) | −12.43 | −14.15 | +1.73 | +12.2% |
| Daily Snowfall (cm) | 0.56 | 0.69 | −0.13 | −18.3% |
| Snow on Ground (cm) | **31.07** | **15.74** | **+15.34** | **+97.5%** |

- Temperatures were **+1.84 °C above baseline** on average, but the month contained extreme swings — a Chinook high of **+13.0 °C on January 14** and an Arctic low of **−30.4 °C on January 23**.
- The defining feature was the snowpack: **31.07 cm on the ground versus the 15.74 cm baseline** — nearly **double** the historical norm. This was driven by the heavy snowfall of December 2025 carrying over and being preserved by January's cold spells.
- The deepest single observation was **47.0 cm at Blatchford on January 4**.

#### 🌡️ February 2026 *(days 1–17 only)*

| Metric | Feb 2026 (1–17) | Baseline (1–17) | Delta | Delta % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mean Temperature (°C) | **−0.46** | **−9.06** | **+8.61** | **+95.0%** |
| Max Temperature (°C) | **+4.12** | **−4.08** | **+8.20** | **+200.8%** |
| Min Temperature (°C) | −5.04 | −14.01 | +8.97 | +64.0% |
| Daily Snowfall (cm) | 1.33 | 0.49 | +0.84 | +171.0% |
| Daily Precipitation (mm) | 0.84 | 0.44 | +0.40 | +89.5% |
| Snow on Ground (cm) | 22.92 | 17.03 | +5.88 | +34.5% |

- The first 17 days of February 2026 produced the **most extreme warm anomaly in the entire dataset**, with a mean of **−0.46 °C against a baseline of −9.06 °C** — a departure of **+8.61 °C**.
- Average daily highs reached **+4.12 °C** — above freezing — against a baseline of −4.08 °C, representing a shift of over **8 °C on the daily maximum alone**.
- To frame the scale: **February 2025 averaged −13.31 °C; February 2026 averaged −0.46 °C** — a swing of nearly **13 °C between the same month in back-to-back years**.
- Snowfall was elevated at **+171% above baseline**, capped by a **12 cm storm on February 16**, the last full day of available data.
- Despite the warmth, the snowpack remained above average at **22.92 cm vs the 17.03 cm baseline** (+34.5%).

### 📊 Per-Station Comparison — January & February 2026

**Figure: `fig16_2026_per_station.png`**

This figure is a 2×2 grid of bar charts, comparing **mean temperature** and **snow on ground** for each of the four full-period stations across January and February 2026. Each chart shows two bars per station — a grey bar for the 2000–2024 baseline and a gold bar for 2026 — with the delta (difference) labelled above each 2026 bar in green (warmer/more snow) or red (colder/less snow).

#### 🔎 What the X-Axis Represents

The X-axis lists the **four weather stations** used in this analysis. Each station is an independent physical instrument installed at a fixed geographic location across the Edmonton region:

| X-Axis Label | Full Station Name | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Blatchford | Edmonton Blatchford | Near downtown Edmonton |
| Int'l CS | Edmonton International CS | Edmonton International Airport |
| Stony Pl. | Edmonton Stony Plain | ~20 km west of Edmonton |
| Stony Pl. CS | Edmonton Stony Plain CS | Co-located with Stony Plain station |

A **weather instrument** in this context refers to the physical equipment installed at each station site. Each station typically includes a combination of:
- A **thermometer** (usually a platinum resistance thermometer housed in a ventilated Stevenson screen) to record daily maximum, minimum, and mean air temperature
- An **ultrasonic or acoustic snow depth sensor** to measure the depth of the snowpack on the ground
- A **precipitation gauge** (tipping bucket or weighing gauge) to capture total rainfall and snowfall accumulation
- A **data logger** that records and transmits readings to Environment Canada automatically

The **CS** (Climate Station) designation indicates instruments maintained to a higher standard of calibration and consistency, specifically for long-term climate trend monitoring rather than day-to-day weather forecasting.

#### 🔍 What the Graph Shows

**Mean Temperature (top row):**
- In **January**, all four stations recorded temperatures above their individual baselines, with deltas ranging from roughly **+1 to +2 °C**. The anomaly was modest and consistent — no single station stood out as an outlier, confirming this was a broad regional warming signal rather than a local effect.
- In **February (days 1–17)**, the warm anomaly was dramatically larger and equally consistent across all four stations — all showing departures of approximately **+8 to +9 °C** above baseline. The uniformity across stations separated by up to 20 km confirms this was a large-scale atmospheric event, not an instrument quirk.

**Snow on Ground (bottom row):**
- In **January**, every station showed a snowpack roughly **double** its baseline value. Blatchford was the most striking, recording around 47 cm at peak versus a January baseline of roughly 15–16 cm.
- In **February**, snowpack remained elevated above baseline at all stations, though less extreme than January as above-freezing daytime highs in the warm spell triggered some surface melting. The pattern was again consistent across all four instruments, reinforcing the regional nature of the signal.

Overall, the per-station consistency across both months is the key takeaway from this figure: **the anomalies were not driven by a single location or a faulty instrument — they reflect genuine, region-wide conditions.**

## 📈 Visualizations

The plots below are organized into three groups: long-term baseline charts, 2025 comparisons, and 2026 comparisons.

---

### 🌡️ Baseline & Long-Term Charts

---

#### Monthly Temperature Normals (2000–2026)

![Monthly Temperature Normals](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig2_monthly_temp_normals.png)

This ribbon chart shows the average **minimum**, **mean**, and **maximum** daily temperatures for each calendar month, computed across all stations and all years. The shaded band between the minimum and maximum lines illustrates how wide the daily temperature range is in each month. Edmonton's climate pattern is immediately clear: five months of below-freezing mean temperatures (November through March), a short peak in July at +17.7 °C, and a steep climb and fall through the shoulder seasons. The zero-degree line is marked with a dotted reference — months where the mean sits above it are effectively snow-melt months; months below it accumulate and preserve snowpack.

---

#### Snowfall Patterns — Monthly Average & Annual Totals

![Snowfall Patterns](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig4_snowfall.png)

A two-panel chart. The **left panel** shows average daily snowfall by month — snowfall is essentially zero from June through August, rises through autumn, and peaks in March, which historically sees the heaviest average daily snowfall of the winter season despite being a transition month. The **right panel** shows the total annual snowfall summed across all stations for each year from 2000 to 2026. Year-to-year variability is substantial, with some years recording far above the long-term mean (dashed red line) and others well below. Notable high-snowfall years include 2011 and 2024. The partial 2026 bar reflects only the data available through February 17.

---

#### Distribution of Daily Mean Temperature by Month

![Temperature Violin Plot](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig5_temp_violin.png)

A violin plot showing the full **statistical distribution** of daily mean temperatures for each calendar month across the entire dataset. The width of each violin at any temperature value represents how frequently that temperature occurred. The white line inside each violin marks the median. Winter months (December–February) have the widest, most spread-out violins, reflecting Edmonton's dramatic winter volatility — a single month can contain both Chinook warmth near zero and Arctic cold below −30 °C. Summer months (July–August) are narrow and symmetrical, indicating much more stable and predictable temperatures. The dotted zero-degree reference line shows that months like April and October straddle freezing, with roughly equal probability of days above and below.

---

#### Extreme Temperature Days per Year

![Extreme Temperature Days](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig6_extreme_days.png)

This grouped bar chart counts, for each year, the number of days where the daily mean temperature fell **below −20 °C** (blue bars — extreme cold) or exceeded **+25 °C** (red bars — extreme heat). Cold extreme days outnumber hot extreme days in almost every year, consistent with Edmonton's sub-arctic continental character. The most notable feature is the **2021 spike in hot extreme days**, directly attributable to the Western Canadian Heat Dome event in late June and early July of that year. Cold extreme peaks appear in 2009, 2019, and 2024 — all years associated with significant Arctic air mass intrusions over the Prairies. The chart makes it visually clear that extreme cold remains a more frequent and consistent feature of Edmonton's climate than extreme heat.

---

#### Average Snow on Ground by Month

![Snow on Ground by Month](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig7_snow_on_ground.png)

A filled area chart showing the average depth of snow on the ground for each calendar month across the full dataset. The snowpack builds progressively from October, peaks in **January–February at roughly 15–18 cm on average**, then declines through March and April as temperatures rise. By May, the average snowpack is near zero. The shape of this curve reflects not just snowfall totals but also melt dynamics — the pack accumulates slowly over months and melts relatively quickly in spring. This chart provides the seasonal snowpack baseline against which the anomalously deep snowpacks of January 2026 (+97.5% above baseline) and 2025 (+39% above baseline) are compared.

### 📅 2025 vs Baseline Charts

---

#### Monthly Mean Temperature: 2025 vs Baseline

![2025 vs Baseline Mean Temperature](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig8_2025_vs_baseline_mean_temp.png)

This line chart plots monthly mean temperatures for **2025** (gold) against the **25-year baseline** (grey), with a shaded band representing ±1 standard deviation around the baseline. The delta for each month is annotated directly above the 2025 line in green (above baseline) or red (below baseline). The chart clearly captures the volatile character of 2025: most months sit above the baseline, but February and December plunge sharply below it. September stands out as the single warmest anomaly (+3.75 °C), while February is the coldest (−4.63 °C). The standard deviation band helps contextualise each month — departures that fall outside the band are statistically unusual even by Edmonton's highly variable standards.

---

#### Monthly Max & Min Temperature: 2025 vs Baseline

![2025 vs Baseline Max Min Temperature](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig9_2025_vs_baseline_max_min.png)

Two side-by-side line charts — one for daily **maximum** temperatures (left, red) and one for daily **minimum** temperatures (right, blue) — each comparing 2025 to the baseline. Green shading highlights months where 2025 was warmer than the baseline; red shading marks months where it was colder. This chart separates the daytime and overnight temperature signals. A notable pattern is that the cold anomalies in February and December 2025 were equally sharp in both the highs and the lows, indicating these were sustained Arctic outbreaks rather than just cold nights. The September warm anomaly is prominent in both panels, confirming that both daytime highs and overnight lows were elevated.

---

#### Monthly Snowfall: 2025 vs Baseline

![2025 vs Baseline Snowfall](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig10_2025_vs_baseline_snowfall.png)

A grouped bar chart comparing average daily snowfall by month for **2025** (gold) versus the **baseline** (grey). The most striking features are the outsized bars in **March** and **December** 2025, both more than double their baseline values. April and May 2025 recorded zero snowfall against small but non-zero baseline values, reflecting the warmer spring. The chart reinforces that 2025's elevated snowpack was not the result of a broadly snowier year, but rather a small number of months with concentrated heavy snowfall events, particularly at the beginning and end of the season.

---

#### Snow on Ground: 2025 vs Baseline

![2025 vs Baseline Snow on Ground](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig11_2025_vs_baseline_snow_on_ground.png)

Two filled area curves — grey for the baseline, gold for 2025 — showing the average monthly snow on ground depth. The 2025 curve sits consistently above the baseline through the winter months, reflecting the cumulative effect of the heavy January and December snowfall. The gap between the curves is most pronounced in the winter core (January–February), where the cold anomalies preserved the deep pack for longer than usual. By the spring months, the curves converge as both the 2025 and baseline snowpacks melt out. The chart provides a clear visual of how snowpack depth behaves as a lagging indicator of snowfall — the December storm effect is still visible in January and February's elevated ground coverage.

---

#### Annual Mean Temperature in Context

![Annual Mean Temperature Context](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig12_annual_temp_context.png)

A bar chart showing the annual mean temperature for every year from 2000 to 2026, with all years shown in grey and **2025 highlighted in gold**. The dashed horizontal line marks the 25-year baseline mean of +3.85 °C. The 2025 bar at +4.61 °C sits clearly above the baseline but is not the highest on record — several earlier years also exceeded it. What distinguishes 2025 is not its annual average but the volatility within the year, which is not visible in this chart but is captured in the monthly breakdowns above. The chart also shows that year-to-year variability is high — annual means span a range of roughly 3–4 °C across the dataset — making any single year's departure from the mean relatively modest in isolation.

---

### 🗓️ 2026 Charts *(January & February 1–17)*

---

#### Daily Mean Temperature: January & February 2026 vs Baseline

![2026 Daily Mean Temperature](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig13_2026_daily_mean_temp.png)

Two side-by-side line charts — one for January and one for February (days 1–17) — plotting the **day-by-day mean temperature** for 2026 (gold) against the baseline daily average (grey), with a ±1 standard deviation band shaded around the baseline. The January panel shows 2026 broadly tracking above the baseline for much of the month, with the notable exception of a sharp Arctic dip around January 23 (−23.9 °C daily mean) and a Chinook spike around January 14 (+7.8 °C daily mean) — both visible as dramatic excursions from the baseline band. The February panel tells a strikingly different story: the gold 2026 line sits well above the grey baseline for the entire observed period, often outside the standard deviation band entirely. The separation between the two lines — nearly 9 °C on average — is visually stark and illustrates just how anomalous the first half of February 2026 was relative to any typical February in the record.

---

#### January & February 2026 vs Baseline — All Key Metrics

![2026 All Metrics](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig14_2026_monthly_all_metrics.png)

A 2×3 grid of bar charts comparing January and February 2026 to the baseline across **all six key metrics**: mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, daily snowfall, snow on ground, and daily precipitation. Each chart shows two grouped bars — grey for baseline, coloured for 2026 — with the delta annotated above the 2026 bar. This is the most comprehensive single-view summary of the 2026 data. The temperature panels confirm the warm anomaly in both months, with February's departures dwarfing January's across all three temperature metrics. The snow on ground panel shows January's near-doubling of the baseline depth. The snowfall and precipitation panels highlight February's elevated activity despite — and partly because of — its anomalous warmth, which favoured heavy, wet snowfall events rather than dry powder typical of cold Alberta winters.

---

#### Daily Snowfall & Snow on Ground: January & February 2026 vs Baseline

![2026 Daily Snow](Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/fig15_2026_daily_snow.png)

A 2×2 grid of day-by-day line charts covering **daily snowfall** (top row) and **snow on ground** (bottom row) for January and February 2026, each compared to the baseline daily average. The January snowfall panel shows a spike on January 1 (7.2 cm at Stony Plain) that contributes to the elevated snowpack visible throughout the rest of the month in the snow-on-ground panel — the pack builds early and stays deep. The February snowfall panel is relatively quiet for the first two weeks but ends with a prominent spike on **February 16 (12.0 cm at Stony Plain)**, the largest single-day snowfall event in the 2026 dataset. The snow-on-ground panels reinforce that despite the exceptional warmth in early February causing some surface melt, the pack never dropped below the baseline — and the February 16 storm pushed it back up sharply by the last day of available data.

## 📊 Data Analysis

The charts in this section take a longer view of the full dataset — 26 years of daily records averaged across all four full-period stations. Three Year × Month heatmaps give a compact visual of how temperature, precipitation, and snowpack behave across the entire calendar and across every year simultaneously. Five trend and extreme-day charts then isolate specific signals: the direction of long-term warming, the frequency of extreme cold and heat, the rhythm of freeze-thaw cycling, and where each individual year sits relative to the 25-year mean.

---

### 🗺️ Climate Heatmaps

---

#### Mean Temperature by Year and Month

![Mean Temperature Heatmap](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig1_heatmap_mean_temp.png)

A Year × Month grid in which each cell is coloured by the **average mean temperature** for that month and year, using a red-blue diverging scale centred on zero. Red cells are above freezing; blue cells are below. The seasonal structure is immediately visible as a repeating horizontal band: deep blue across the winter columns (December through February), a gradient through the shoulder months, and warm red across June through August. Reading vertically down any individual month reveals year-to-year variability — some Januaries are a lighter blue than others, and some Julys are a deeper red.

Two events stand out clearly when scanning the grid. The **June–July 2021 cells** are among the most intensely red in the entire chart, marking the Western Canadian Heat Dome that pushed Edmonton to its all-time maximum of +38.5 °C. In contrast, **January 2024** appears as one of the darkest blue cells in the January column, reflecting the Arctic outbreak on January 12 that produced the dataset's all-time coldest daily mean of −40.2 °C. The **February 2026 row** shows a notably lighter blue than any other February in the chart, consistent with the +8.61 °C warm anomaly documented in the 2026 comparison section above.

Reading the chart from top to bottom — year by year — there is a subtle but discernible shift toward lighter blues in winter and deeper reds in summer in more recent rows, consistent with a long-term warming signal that the regression chart below quantifies more precisely.

---

#### Monthly Total Precipitation by Year

![Precipitation Heatmap](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig2_heatmap_precipitation.png)

A Year × Month grid coloured by **monthly total precipitation** in millimetres, on a yellow-to-dark-blue scale where deeper blue indicates higher precipitation. Months with no recorded precipitation appear near-white. The dominant pattern is a summer concentration: June, July, and August consistently show the darkest shading, reflecting Edmonton's continental precipitation regime where convective rainfall is the main source of moisture and is largely confined to the warm season. Winter months are pale throughout — most precipitation that does fall in winter arrives as snow, and the liquid-equivalent accumulation per month is much lower.

The chart is useful for spotting anomalously wet or dry years in specific seasons. Notably, **June and July cells vary considerably in depth year to year**, reflecting the high variability of convective summer rainfall. A few individual cells stand out as particularly dark, corresponding to years with concentrated multi-day rain events. The **summer of 2021** shows elevated precipitation alongside its extreme heat, consistent with the atmospheric instability that followed the heat dome event. The partial **2026 row** reflects only January and February and will fill in as the year progresses.

---

#### Average Snow on Ground by Year and Month

![Snow on Ground Heatmap](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig3_heatmap_snow_on_ground.png)

A Year × Month grid coloured by the **average depth of snow on the ground** in centimetres, on a white-to-dark-blue scale. Summer months (June through September) are uniformly white — no snowpack. The winter arc (November through April) fills in with progressively darker shading as the pack builds and fades. The snowpack typically peaks in **January and February**, where the darkest cells cluster, before thinning through March and melting out in April and May.

Year-to-year variation is striking in this chart. Some winters have a consistently deep and dark winter arc; others are noticeably lighter, indicating thinner or more transient snowpacks. **January 2026** stands out as one of the darkest cells in the January column — its average of 31.07 cm across the four stations was nearly double the baseline of 15.74 cm (+97.5%). **2011** also shows a notably deep snowpack, consistent with the all-time recorded snowpack depth of 70.0 cm at Stony Plain on January 18 of that year. Conversely, several years show very pale January and February cells, indicating winters where snowfall was light or Chinook events melted the pack early.

The heatmap also captures the **lagging nature of snowpack relative to snowfall**: heavy December snowfall events appear as a dark December cell that carries over into a dark January and February, exactly as seen in the 2025–2026 transition where December 2025's record snowfall produced the anomalous January 2026 pack.

### 📈 Long-Term Trends & Extremes

---

#### Annual Mean Temperature and Long-Term Trend

![Annual Temperature Trend](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig4_annual_temp_trend.png)

A bar chart showing the **annual mean temperature** for each year from 2000 to 2026, with bars coloured warm red when the year's mean exceeded the dataset's long-run average and cold blue when it fell below. A gold OLS regression line — fitted to the 2000–2024 baseline period — is overlaid to show the direction and magnitude of the long-term temperature trend. The slope, r², and p-value are annotated in the legend.

The chart reveals meaningful year-to-year variability layered on top of a gradual upward trend. **2021** is one of the tallest warm bars, driven by the heat dome in June and July lifting the annual mean well above average. **2024** sits on the cooler side of the distribution, pulled down by the January 12 Arctic outbreak — a reminder that single extreme events can meaningfully shift an annual average. **2025**, at +4.61 °C, appears as a clearly above-average bar, but is not the highest in the record — illustrating that 2025's significance lies in its within-year volatility rather than its annual total. The regression line's positive slope indicates a warming trend over the 25-year window, though the wide scatter of individual years around the line reflects how high Edmonton's natural year-to-year variability is relative to the underlying trend signal.

---

#### Extreme Cold Days per Year

![Extreme Cold Days](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig5_extreme_cold_days.png)

A bar chart counting the number of days per year where the **daily mean temperature fell below −20 °C**, with a gold dashed reference line marking the 25-year average count. This threshold represents genuine deep-winter cold — temperatures at this level cause significant stress on infrastructure, vehicles, and outdoor workers, and are broadly referred to as "extreme cold" in public health contexts.

The count fluctuates substantially from year to year. Several years cluster near or below the long-run average, reflecting winters dominated by mild or Chinook-influenced patterns. Others spike considerably higher — most notably years associated with documented Arctic air mass intrusions over the Prairies. **2024** stands out with a high count driven largely by the January 12 outbreak, which was so severe that multiple stations simultaneously recorded daily means below −40 °C. **2009** and **2019** are also elevated years, consistent with the EDA findings that these were years of significant cold extremes. The overall pattern does not show a clean declining trend — extreme cold days remain a recurring feature of Edmonton's winters even in a warming climate, appearing in discrete outbreak episodes rather than as a steady background condition.

---

#### Extreme Hot Days per Year

![Extreme Hot Days](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig6_extreme_hot_days.png)

A bar chart counting the number of days per year where the **daily mean temperature exceeded +25 °C**, with a gold dashed reference line marking the 25-year average. Days in this range represent the warmest tail of Edmonton's summer distribution — uncomfortably hot by local standards and associated with elevated wildfire risk and heat-health advisories.

Hot extreme days are far less frequent than cold extreme days in most years, and in many years the count is very low or near zero. The dominant feature of this chart is the **2021 bar**, which towers above every other year by a wide margin — the direct signature of the Western Canadian Heat Dome, which drove Edmonton's daily means above +25 °C for an extended stretch in late June and early July. No other year in the 26-year record comes close to matching 2021's hot extreme count, making it visually obvious as an outlier rather than part of a gradual upward progression. While there is some suggestion that hot extreme days have become slightly more common in more recent years relative to the early 2000s, the dominant story in this chart is the exceptionality of 2021 — an event that climate scientists have described as essentially impossible without the background warming caused by human greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Freeze-Thaw Cycles per Year

![Freeze-Thaw Cycles](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig7_freeze_thaw_cycles.png)

A bar chart counting the number of days per year where the **daily minimum temperature fell below 0 °C and the daily maximum temperature rose above 0 °C on the same calendar day** — the definition of a freeze-thaw cycle. These events are significant beyond weather observation: repeated freeze-thaw cycles are one of the primary drivers of road surface damage, concrete cracking, water main breaks, and permafrost degradation. They are most common in the **shoulder seasons** — particularly October and April — when temperatures oscillate around the freezing point rather than sitting reliably above or below it.

The annual count is relatively stable across the dataset compared to the extreme-day charts, typically ranging within a band that reflects the structural regularity of Edmonton's shoulder seasons. Years where winters were mild and prolonged tend to accumulate more freeze-thaw days, as temperatures hover near zero rather than plunging deep into the cold. The **2025 pattern** is worth noting in this context: its warm shoulder seasons (March through November were broadly above baseline) would tend to increase freeze-thaw day counts in spring and autumn, while the deep cold of February and December would suppress them in those months. The gold reference line allows quick identification of which years ran above or below the long-run cycle frequency.

#### Annual Temperature Anomaly vs 2000–2024 Baseline

![Annual Temperature Anomaly](Data%20Analysis/plots/fig8_annual_temp_anomaly.png)

A bar chart showing the **deviation of each year's annual mean temperature from the 2000–2024 baseline mean of +3.85 °C**. Bars extending upward (red) indicate years warmer than the long-run average; bars extending downward (blue) indicate cooler years. The two most extreme years — the warmest and coldest anomalies in the record — are annotated with their year label and delta value. A horizontal zero line marks the baseline.

This chart strips away the absolute temperature values and focuses purely on departure from the long-run norm, making it the clearest single view of which years were unusual and by how much. The distribution of bars is not symmetric: there are more positive (warm) anomalies than negative ones in the recent portion of the record, and the largest positive anomalies tend to be more recent than the largest negative ones — a visual pattern consistent with a warming climate. **2021** registers as a strongly positive anomaly year. **2025**, at +0.76 °C above baseline, appears as a moderate positive bar — meaningful but not the record. The partial **2026** bar, representing only January and February, already shows a positive anomaly driven by the exceptional warmth of early February, though it will shift as the full year accumulates. The annotated extremes anchor the viewer's interpretation of the scale — the range from coldest to warmest annual anomaly in the 26-year record spans roughly 3–4 °C, which is a substantial spread for a dataset of this length.
